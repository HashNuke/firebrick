## Development

#### Ruby

You'll have to install Ruby if you are touching any of the assets (coffeescripts or stylesheets).

Run the following commands to install the `bundler` rubygem and then the other dependencies.

* `gem install bundler` - installs the bundler rubygem
* `bundle install` - Other ruby dependencies


#### Asset compilation

After installing the Ruby dependencies, you can compile assets using any of the following commands:

* `bundle exec rake assets:compile` - Compile assets

* `bundle exec rake assets:watch` - Watch assets for changes during development and compile them.
